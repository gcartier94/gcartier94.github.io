# > the agentic nation

[2025-09-13 15:49:13] 

[early draft]

The world has changed again, like it did many times before and like it will many times after, but this time it might be different. This time we might have reached an inflection point, a point of no return.

I believe there is a "Olympus" of a select group of technologies that were able to fundamentally shift the way we live our lives through out the history. The steam engine, radio, TV, the internet, this last one opening the door to many other breakthroughs like social media, smartphones, etc.. 

It might be too soon to say how historians will remember the times we are living today, but the truth is that Generative AI is part of everyone's lives some way or the other. For the good or the bad, we need to learn to live in a world where GenAI is everywhere. This is one of the reasons I've made a [personal commitment] on the usage of AI in this blog

Like I've mentioned on a [previous blog], LLMs have opened the door to another breakthrough, AI Agents. If you've read the book [kill it with fire](#) by ... you know that concepts like these are never entirely new, and that innovation is a flat circle.

With this in mind, I started to think about the possibilities, how the agentic systems will dictate how other systems are built. Most systems we use today take UI and UX very seriously, but what if the main users of these systems are no longer human? Should we start to think about our systems from the perspective of an agent? 

Think about our systems today as cities, they are sprawling with humans everywhere, most of the design of our cities were made taking in consideration the human experience. But as AI agents advance maybe we will reach a point where many of these spaces will no longer be occupied by humans, a city once brimming with humans, now completely devoided of life, mindless agents now carry out the tasks from their owners.

What if in the future our experience with web browsers is completely different. No longer you will have to type the page address, you will chat with an agent and say what you want to do, the agent will take care of the rest for you.
