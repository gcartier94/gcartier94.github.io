Welcome to Coffee Meditations 

My name is Guilherme Cartier and this is the space where I pause to reflect, explore, and occasionally ramble about the things that keep me up at night (and the caffeine that helps me enjoy it).

Expect musings on systems architecture and the occasional philosophical detour. Whether you're here for insights, inspiration, or just a good read with your morning brewâ€”I'm glad you stopped by.
